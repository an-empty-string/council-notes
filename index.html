            <h1>Government Notes</h1>
            <p>I don't summarize every meeting I attend &mdash; that would take way too much time! However, I do record every meeting I go to and usually take some notes &mdash; these are available for meetings that are listed below without a link. To get a copy of these materials, first try looking for them on <a href="https://github.com/an-empty-string/council-notes">this site's GitHub repository</a> &mdash; I publish unedited outlines / unfinished summaries there. If you need recordings or don't find notes there, please email me at <a href="mailto:tris@tris.fyi">tris@tris.fyi</a> and we'll work things out.</p>
