                        <h2 id="of-general-interest">Of General
                        Interest</h2>
                        <p><strong>I-7d</strong>: The <em>Valley
                        View</em> development on north Memorial Parkway
                        (10028 Memorial Pkwy NW) failed to receive
                        rezoning approval with a 4-5 vote. A North
                        Carolina developer (Pioneer Communities)
                        petitioned for this property to be rezoned from
                        R-1 to R-2 in order to take advantage of the
                        less restrictive lot density requirements.</p>
                        <p>This development was fairly controversial in
                        the community. Councilmember Keith hosted a
                        meeting on the original development <a
                        href="https://twitter.com/an_empty_string/status/1532157701970616320">in
                        early June</a> to mixed reception. Many people
                        voiced concerns about the build quality of the
                        project (Pioneer intended to build some type of
                        manufactured homes, although this plan was later
                        scrapped because manufactured homes are not
                        lawful to build in R1 or R2 zones), potential
                        impact on property values in the area, and the
                        long-term upkeep of the development.</p>
                        <p>Pioneer’s model was fairly unique.
                        Originally, they intended to maintain ownership
                        of their lot without going through the
                        subdivision process, instead charging a lot
                        lease fee while still selling buildings. This
                        model contributed to property upkeep and resale
                        value concerns. While I’m not privy to
                        discussions that happened between the June
                        community meeting and tonight’s Planning
                        Commission meeting, it sounded like Planning
                        staff were not very interested in this
                        either.</p>
                        <p>As of the June community meeting, Pioneer had
                        1,138 units “under development” in Alabama, with
                        0 units occupied or ready for occupancy.</p>

                        <p><strong>I-2</strong>: There were several
                        concerns from the public about this preliminary
                        layout approval for a development on Segers Rd
                        (<a
                        href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Segers+Rd,+Alabama+35756/@34.680506,-86.8095302,1218m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x8862647c158e8c7b:0xfc16f97bacd17e4d!8m2!3d34.6927022!4d-86.8156578">Google
                        Maps</a>):</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>A concern was brought involging solids from
                        the construction process making their way down
                        to the creek to the South. The project’s
                        engineer of record stated that this is “typical”
                        on construction sites and should resolve after
                        construction is complete.</li>
                        <li>A concern was brought involving impact to
                        the park and wetlands nearby. Nunez and the
                        project’s engineer of record stated that this
                        development does not extend to the wetlands and
                        there should be “minimal disturbance.” Based on
                        discussion between the engineer of record and
                        Commission members, the subdivision’s park is
                        platted as a common area, and any development in
                        that area would likely need to go through the
                        subdivision’s HOA (not necessarily through
                        Planning Commission).</li>
                        <li>There were several concerns brought
                        involving traffic impact and ingress/egress
                        points on this development, since the
                        preliminary layout would result in greater than
                        200 lots, requiring two such points. Nunez
                        stated that while no traffic study was
                        performed, based on traffic counts that are
                        available, there will be an impact of less than
                        1% to Segers Rd by daily trip count. There is
                        also a second egress point for this subdivision
                        already built to the East, although it’s not
                        reflected on maps provided by city GIS and is
                        outside of city limits.</li>
                        <li>A concern was brought about some of the
                        proposed lots lying within a floodplain. The
                        engineer of record stated that these lots will
                        have additional dirt added to raise them above
                        the floodplain, and flood insurance will not be
                        required for the eventual owners of those
                        lots.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>I-7e</strong>: Several folks were
                        present to speak about this rezoning request,
                        which changes 1.5 acres of a lot from Light
                        Industry zoning to R2-B, with a plat restriction
                        permitting only uses allowed in R1:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>There were concerns about a larger lot being
                        rezoned from LI to R2-B, but these turned out to
                        not be relevant — the rezoning request only
                        covers 1.5 acres.</li>
                        <li>There were concerns about multifamily
                        development in this area. This cannot happen due
                        to the plat restriction permitting only uses
                        allowed in R1.</li>
                        <li>There were concerns about traffic impacts,
                        which seemed largely unfounded — Nunez estimates
                        that this land could be subdivided into only 4
                        or 5 single-family lots.</li>
                        </ul>

                        Oddities</h2>
                        <p><strong>I-7f</strong>: This rezoning request
                        (from R2 to R2-B) was initially approved with
                        the understanding that there was an existing
                        plat restriction permitting development only to
                        R2-A’s density controls. However, at the end of
                        the meeting, legal counsel and Nunez told the
                        Commission that they also had to approve that
                        existing plat restriction at the same time as
                        the rezoning request in order for the
                        restriction to be effective.</p>
                        <p>The chair made a motion to reconsider item
                        7f, then a motion to approve the item and the
                        plat restriction together. Both passed
                        unanimously.</p>
