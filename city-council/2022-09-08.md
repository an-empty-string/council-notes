# 7b + 17 - Huntsville Utilities

Wes Kelly (sp?)

Recent electric rates:
* fuel cost adjustment is passthrough from TVA
* Gas generation is becoming a bigger part of TVA's production (most of coal's shrink)
* Nuclear/coal are not commodity-driven sources, gas is
* Generator maintenance + gas prices + high demand (June esp)
* Many different factors factored into gas prices - incl stored, hedging, derivatives...
    * "fuel [price] hedging"
    * Price commitments / "purchase options"

* Gas exports to Europe are pushing up prices
* Other supply chain issues
    * Transformers up 56% (at least!), ductile iron pipe up 110%, excess flow valves up 83%
    * Transformers: 1 domestic manufacturer of core steel (!)
        * Surplus brokers
        * EVs also use core steel

* Systems growing at 2-3%/yr
* Water system specifically needs more funding - probable rate increase, bond issuance
    * Salaries are now closer to 50% of water expenses
    * Industrial facilities close to city limits are a problem for central water infra!
    * Fire flows are the major issue

* Gas - similar issues, pipe in the ground
* Electric - tons of infra projects

Capital projects

Regional rate comparisons
- We are still the cheapest in electric
- 2nd from lowest in gas
- Still the lowest on water - "best water system in the state"

Projects

* Deposit interest refund - happening now
    * Bond rating agencies don't count held deposit interest as cash on hand
    * Yearly - in Feb

* Community support - payed by non-ratepayer sources
    * e.g. RSA utility maintenance, GFiber network lease
    * FY23 - work w/ Huntsville Community Foundation
    * Probably also Project Share support

Q's

Keith via Meredith - discuss single board
    * 3 statutes, there are 3 separate legal entities that provide services
    * Public Act 175 - "fairly straightforward" in execution, "more complicated" from a legal/financial standpoint
    * Does not require state action - requires council resolution

    * Tree cutting?
        * "Not going to back up at all" - "core to reliability"

Robinson
    * Energy independence pls
    * Recent electric outages
        * A: Many issues - infra age, but also car accidents
        * New outage management system in progress - should have better metrics on this Soon(TM)
        * "our PR team is doing a better job than ever of reporting our outages"
    * Wants rate increases strongly tied to reliability improvements too
    * Faulty meter readings
    * Purchased power
        * Electricity - all TVA
        * Gas - big oil companies
    * Can we sell our power?
        * Soon(TM)
    * When do we raise the $25k cap?
        * PA175 - consolidated board would remove the cap
        * Otherwise requires local law
    * Cybersecurity funding for the electric grid?
        * 2 FTEs

Kling - more of a comment than a question moment
    * Translation services
    * Can we do fewer capital projects?? haha only serious
        * A: More of an issue on water, but basically no

Akridge
    * TVA x HSV Utilities meeting outcomes?
        * A: FCA has hopefully reached its peak
    * Water increases - would like to get ahead of conservation requirements
    * Are you included in the annexation workflow?
        * We often hear from developers first
        * "usually in the loop"

Meredith
    * Why not more hydro?
        * A: TVA question, but dams are "environmentally complicated"

Battle
    * Development/admin staff meet with Utilities 1x/month
    * Spend as necessary, don't needlessly cut budget
    * New operations building EMP resilience?
        * yeag

17/a/b/c approved unanimously

# 20v, for some reason

Ampitheater operations - leases between city and building authority, and subleasing to Huntsville Venue Group and subsidiaries

1 - restated operating and management agreement. no material elements about "how the ampitheater is operated", or "financial structures and processes" - some technical fixes for "HVG" vs "HVG Ampitheater", Also, combined existing amendments into this document. Real estate descriptions corrected in leases between PBA, City, and others.
2/3 - PBA leases to city - 2 separate leases because of how debt instruments are tied to one of them.
4 - sublease to HVG F&B
5 - termination agreement of previous ground lease, _and_ 2021 development agreement. HVG and City want to change the direction of development there. Mutual agreement.

Entities - TVG = The Venue Group Hospitality, Huntsville office is generically "HVG". Parent company of HVG F&B, HVG Ampitheater, other private investments.

Not trying to change the vision here -- it's making the park available for the ampitheater folks and letting the space work cohesively

Sublease to F&B - 7% of gross revenue, also completed $3.5M in capital improvements and $600k in public art. Lessee responsible for construction (est $5m).

Akridge
    * Please explain the PBA
        * A: 3-member board (banker, developer, former city council)
        * Have more options for construction contracts
        * New city hall & current county jail, along with the ampitheater
    * How did HVG get the F&B spot?
        * was "always going to be" an HVG entity
        * some technical quirks around alcohol licensing and what is "single premises"
    * Are they hiring "the best" F&B operators?
        * confident in this since we are already working with them on this project, for over a year
        * Battle: they're invested in making sure this works
    * Do we keep rights to review who they are hiring?
        * no but we have to review certain contracts, budget approval, etc

Robinson
    * "Incredibly impressed"
    * [thing] architect structure
    * what will it look like
        * mostly finished, need some concrete poured, but utility service is there
        * "really fancy looking barn"

Meredith
    * "in and out" privileges to the food village during events?
        * yes - gates are structured with this in mind
