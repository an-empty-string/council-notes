                        <p>Mayor Battle was absent from today’s meeting
                        (away on city business). In his place, someone
                        put a bouquet of flowers and papered over his
                        nameplate with “in loving memory of Ms. Jackie
                        Reed.” The first act of the council was to
                        appoint Jackie Reed as “honorary mayor” for the
                        evening (moved by Kling, seconded by Meredith,
                        unanimously carried).</p>

                        <p><strong>20j</strong>: The Nashville Soccer
                        Club is launching a <a
                        href="https://www.mlsnextpro.com/about/">MLS
                        NEXT Pro</a> soccer team in Huntsville, after
                        their 10-year lease of Joe Davis Stadium was
                        approved unanimously by council. Highlights of
                        the lease agreement include:</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li>The team is responsible for facility
                        operation and maintenance, at no cost to the
                        city</li>
                        <li>The stadium operation team must accommodate
                        other users, with priority given to school
                        system sports teams on certain nights (and the
                        school system does not need to pay a rental fee
                        to use the field).</li>
                        <li>The lease agreement alone will add $10
                        million to the city’s balance sheet in the first
                        10 years.</li>
                        <li>In addition, the city receives a facility
                        fee for every ticket sold at a price greater
                        than $10.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Hamilton mentioned that temporary paint
                        technology means the field can be used for
                        basically any game that works on a rectangular
                        field.</p>
                        <p>The team is expected to take possession of
                        the stadium next May.</p>

                        <p>Agenda-related public comment started with 3
                        minutes of silence. There was no substantial
                        agenda-related comment (one individual had
                        questions about the legal authority Community
                        Development uses during the notice and
                        demolition process, however).</p>
                        <p>Chad Chavez noted that the speaker roster
                        tends to get collected a bit too early during
                        council meetings. (Council bylaws say that
                        citizens may sign up to speak through the end of
                        item 20; Chavez says the list was collected
                        about 45 minutes in advance of this.) He
                        mentions the <a

                        Golden Padlock Award</a> and describes this
                        year’s HPD annual report as much sparser than
                        those of previous years (this is true, I’ve read
                        the annual report and it is really lacking in
                        actually useful information other than
                        high-level crime statistics).</p>

                        <ul>
                        <li>apologized for some rude comments she made
                        last meeting about a citizen petition</li>
                        <li>noted her attendance at the recent HPCAC

                        Park; comments and ideas about the park can go

                        Human Relations Commission</li>
                        <li>noted that HPCAC wants to go from 12
                        meetings per year minimum to 4 (sounded like
                        they wanted to focus more on fewer topics, but
                        the exact reasoning here was unclear)</li>

                        <li>specifically mentions Jackie Reed’s “legacy
                        of engagement” and encourages folks to show up
                        and hold their leaders accountable.</li>
                        <li>noted her drop-in meetings are a great

                        <p>Kling gives us a trash truck ordering update.
                        It sounds like a total of 9 additional trucks —
                        6 boom trucks and 3 automated trucks — will be
                        delivered by the end of the year, with the first
                        scheduled to arrive in October.</p>

                        TARCOG or something else) as a way council
                        identifies opportunities for collaboration with
                        neighboring government entities on more than
                        just road infrastructure</li>
                        <li>notes the upcoming Presidential Forum on
                        August 2nd (doesn’t seem to be on the city
                        calendar yet); it’s about diversity, equity, and

                        Oddities</h2>
                        <p><strong>12</strong>: Mayor Battle was out, so
                        Hamilton made nominations from the floor during
                        the usual mayor comment period.</p>
                        <p><strong>15b</strong> and
                        <strong>15d</strong>: These two items are board
                        appointments to the same seat. Initially,
                        neither had enough votes to pass. After
                        realizing that the bylaws for this board leave
                        seats filled until replacements are elected,
                        Kling moved to reconsider 14b, and Chase Allen’s
                        appointment to the Alabama Constitution Village
                        and Historic Huntsville Depot Board, Place 7,
                        passed in a 4-1 vote with Akridge as the only
                        “no” vote.</p>
                        <p><strong>16a</strong>: Keith requested that
                        this appointment be voted on in the first
                        council meeting in August.</p>
                        <p><strong>16</strong>: Akridge nominated Lynn
                        Troy (spelling?) to the Von Braun Center Board
                        of Control from the floor. Keith requested that
                        this nomination also be voted on in August.</p>
                        <p><strong>19e</strong>: Introduced by Akridge,
                        not by Public Transportation. Akridge wanted to
                        revise the ordinance to require a dedicated
                        employee to tend to horses pulling carriages
                        during disembarkment and boarding only “if
                        possible”, instead of having a blanket
                        requirement. Robinson successfully moved to
                        postpone consideration of this matter.</p>

                        routine, but a real estate developer spoke up
                        about wanting to buy the property in question.
                        Community Development and Akridge noted that if
                        an unsafe property is brought up at council for
                        demolition, it’s way too late to buy that
                        property and fix it. Hamilton noted that
                        property sales are fully independent of any
                        Community Development action, and the city
                        doesn’t necessarily have the authority to sell
                        the property at all.</p>
                        <p><strong>9d</strong>: Akridge mentions that
                        Stan Smith, who was issued a horse-drawn
                        carriage operator license, might be operating
                        such carriages on private property (which
                        explains the “streets and routes” language in
                        <strong>19e</strong>).</p>
                        <p><strong>17</strong>: Keith (I think? not
                        clear in my notes) mentions that Huntsville
                        Utilities will be giving a general update to
                        council at the first meeting in September.</p>
                        <p><strong>19b</strong>: Akridge asked why old
                        vehicles were being disposed of as surplus given
                        the extreme issues getting vehicles in this
                        supply chain environment. Ricky Wilkinson,
                        director of general services and fleet, noted
                        that the repair cost for issues in these
                        vehicles had exceeded their actual value or were
                        otherwise deemed unfit for service.</p>
                        <p><strong>19d</strong>: This could result in a
                        significant pay bump during future promotions
                        for city employees. The current pay system gives
                        city employees a 5% raise target during any
                        promotion event, even if the promotion would
                        normally be several pay grades above their
                        current level. This amends the pay structure to
                        guarantee a 5% raise per grade increase.
                        Hamilton says most grade increases are two steps
                        or more. This ordinance also amends service
                        anniversary dates for firefighters and police
                        officers so that there aren’t months-long pay
                        disparities between members of the same academy
                        graduating class.</p>
                        <p><strong>20o</strong>: Council approved
                        demolition of the (now vacant) Butler Terrace
                        apartments to make way for the new Mill Creek
                        Choice Neighborhood plan. Keith noted that
                        council and city administration need to make a
                        concerted push to actually get started on
                        construction in this development soon. Kling
                        mentioned that affordable housing needs to be
                        spread throughout the city, and not just be
                        concentrated in one area.</p>
